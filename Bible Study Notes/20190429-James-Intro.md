# James Introduction

Sometimes called “the Proverbs of the New Testament,” the book of James practically and faithfully reminds Christians how to live.

This short epistle has become famous for its supposed conflict with Paul’s teaching of justification by faith. In light of its themes on wealth and worldliness, James may be the most relevant NT book for the church of the 21st century, especially the Western church.

### Author

The author says nothing of himself other than that he is “James, a bond-servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.”

(1) The apostle James, son of Zebedee and brother of the apostle John (Mt 4:21; 10:2; Ac 1:13a), can be considered only if the book was written before his death in AD 44.

(2) The book is usually attributed to James, the Lord’s half-brother (Mk 6:3), since he gained distinction as the leader of the church in Jerusalem (Ac 12:17; 15:13; 21:18). Early church leaders largely support this opinion (e.g., Eusebius, Origen).

James appears to be the oldest of four half-brothers born to Mary and Joseph (Mt 13:55; Mk 6:3). He did not believe in Jesus as the Christ until after the resurrection (Ac 1:14). Some hold that he is the James to whom the Lord made a special resurrection appearance (1Co 15:7).

### Date

If the Lord’s half-brother wrote the book, it must have been written before his death in **AD 62** (the date given by Josephus, Ant. XX.9.1). An early date is supported by the lack of any mention of a Jewish/Gentile controversy as found in Acts (Ac 15) or the Epistles (e.g., Galatians)

If the dispersion in 1:1 refers to the scattering of Jewish believers in Ac 8:1, dated at about AD 34, the book could have been written as early as AD 35–36. James is probably the first NT book written.

James, like a few other lesser-known letters (2 Peter, 2–3 John, Jude), was not widely accepted as Scripture until late in the fourth century. This was because the early church focused first on the Gospels and the letters of Paul. Since James did not have apostolic authorship, it remained less widely received at first.

### Recipients

Numerous details best fit a Mediterranean location for the readers (3:12; 5:7). Both Syrian Antioch (cf. Gl 2:12) and the land of Israel have been suggested.

These Jewish believers had been displaced from their homes as the result of persecution (1:1). Some of the readers were being mistreated for their faith (2:7; 5:1-4). Financial difficulties tempted them to focus on wealth (4:13), envy the rich (2:2), and become worldly (4:4).

While the readers perceived themselves as having wisdom, they actually lacked it.

Readers suffered from prayerlessness (4:2). They thought of God as miserly (1:16-17) and unmerciful (5:11). As a result, they became unmerciful like the God they envisioned (2:6, 15-16).

The author never questioned the sincerity of the readers’ faith. He addressed the readers as “brothers,” “beloved brothers,” or “my beloved brothers,” a total of 19 times.

The dominating themes of maturity and “rich faith” help define the readers’ “faith” as an immature (but genuine) faith (see commentary at 2:17). **The readers needed to become mature Christians**, combining faith and works.

### Themes

Major subjects include: 

- The believer’s response to trials, temptation, and suffering
- The need for works to be added to faith for spiritual growth
- The value of controlling the tongue
- A biblical perspective on wealth, worldly possessions, and the poor
- The significance of faith in prayer; and a biblical understanding of wisdom

The letter alludes frequently to the teachings of Jesus. Numerous parallels exist, especially with the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7).
